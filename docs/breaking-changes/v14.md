# Breaking changes in v14

We are bumping `eslint-plugin-n` 3 major versions, from v14 to v17. v17 is the most up-to-date version, and is the only version that is actively supported. v15 and v16 support older versions of node, and are on end-of-life support. The breaking changes are related to dropping support for older versions of node. We are cutting a new major for these changes for clarity, as there are ultimately changes in the underlying configuration due to these changes as well.
