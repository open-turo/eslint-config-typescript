# Breaking changes in v16

The following plugins are getting replaced by [eslint-plugin-perfectionist](https://github.com/azat-io/eslint-plugin-perfectionist):

- [eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort](https://github.com/lydell/eslint-plugin-simple-import-sort)
- [eslint-plugin-sort-destructure-keys](https://github.com/mthadley/eslint-plugin-sort-destructure-keys)
- [eslint-plugin-typescript-sort-keys](https://github.com/infctr/eslint-plugin-typescript-sort-keys/tree/master)

If you were reconfiguring some of the rules from these plugins in your eslint config you will have to update them and reference
the equivalent rule from https://perfectionist.dev/rules.
