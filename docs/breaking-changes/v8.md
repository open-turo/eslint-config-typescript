# Breaking changes in v8

Stricter dependencies by moving away from peer dependencies into dependencies for most of the eslint configs and plugins this
library uses.

When used, this module is the single eslint config that is added to the project. Having to add the peer dependencies
makes dependency management much more complicated.

Since this module is already opinionated, having dependencies as regular ones makes maintenance a lot easier.

eslint-plugin-unicorn version is now 51.0.0

eslint-plugin-sonarjs version is now 0.24.0

## Upgrade instructions

Update to v8 of the module. Remove all peer dependencies this module had from your
`package.json` file that are no longer needed (only `eslint` and `prettier` remain).

```shell
npx install-peerdeps --dev @open-turo/eslint-config
```

And fix all lint errors.
