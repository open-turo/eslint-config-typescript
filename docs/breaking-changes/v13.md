# Breaking changes in v13

We are replacing `eslint-plugin-node` with `eslint-plugin-n`. See https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n

If you were reconfiguring some of the node rules in your eslint config you will have to update them:

```diff
-    "node/no-missing-import": "off",
+    "n/no-missing-import": "off",
```
